Brief Project Description

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application along with its dependencies, ensuring consistent operation across different environments. Docker simplifies software development by enabling developers to create, test, and deploy applications quickly and reliably. Key components of Docker include Docker Engine, Docker Hub, Docker Compose, and Docker Swarm, each facilitating different aspects of container management and orchestration. Docker's efficiency, portability, and scalability make it a popular choice for modern software development and DevOps practices.

What is Docker?
Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

ocker was introduced in 2013 by Docker, Inc. It gained rapid adoption due to its ability to simplify the development and deployment processes. It was built on the idea of containers, a concept that had been around in various forms for years, but Docker made it more accessible and practical.
